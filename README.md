# FATES_parameters
A location for sharing and managing non-default versions of FATES parameter scripts and files. 

The idea here is that we have a common location for sharding parameter files and the scripts that generate them from the base files, to facilirate progress on defining a 'default' PFT set. 

The idea is that some things are shared (the tools and the base PFT files) and that each person developing PFT files has their own area to make candidate changes, etc. 

I've added folders and write access for people I think might be doing this kind of work already. Please ask if you'd also like write access. I put this in Git so that it could be integrated in real time with people's workflows (avoiding a 'now copy this to google drive' phase, but that comes with a little overhead in terms of access. Ideas on this are welcome! 

This of course needs populating with more scripts and examples. It could also be used to house analysis scripts and workflows if people were into that. 

More discussion on the FATES call later today (3 Sept '20)
